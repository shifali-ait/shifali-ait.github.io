            Chittorgarh, also called Chittaur, from the 7th century to the 16th, was the capital of Mewar under the Rajputs. Chittaur evokes memories of great heroism and sacrifice by Rajput men and women in the intermittent battles that they had to fight against invaders from Northwest or Delhi. Chittaur witnessed both the ravages of war and the triumphs of the spirit. Allaudin Khilji who coveted Queen Padmini of Chittaur, invaded the city in 1303 A.D. Queen Padmini and the women of the court sacrificed themselves in a pyre of fire rather than submit to anybody. This supreme sacrifice has been called 'Jauhar' and epitomises the fiery spirit of the Rajputs of the day. The city stands strewn with monuments and battlements as evidence of the blood and gore that it went through in medieval times.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chittaur Fort is the best known fort in Rajasthan. Its origins are traced to the Pandavas of Mahabharata. It is said that Bhima, one of the Pandava brothers, built the fort. Standing on 180 meters high hill, the fort covers an area of 700 Acres. Inside it is the Meera and Khumba Shyam Temple. It is associated with Meera, a mystic poetess devoted to Lord Krishna whose life and bhajans have become part of the folklore and literary traditions of the region and several parts of India.
          </p>
          <p>Chittorgarh (Chittaurgarh) is the epitome of Rajput pride, romance and spirit. It reverberates with history of heroism and sacrifice, which is evident as it echoes with the tales sung by the Bards of Rajasthan. The main reason for visiting Chittorgarh is its massive hilltop fort, which is a depiction of Rajput culture and values.

            The fort of Chittor is regarded as one of the most outstanding forts of the country and is indeed the "Pride of Rajasthan State". The formidable fort is perched atop a 180 meter high hillock covering a massive area of 700 acres and is a standing sentinel to the courage and valour of Chittorgarh. It is belived that the fort was build by the Mauryans in 7th century and further strucres were added to it by the successive Mewar rulers.

            The one mile long serpentine road to the fort is quite steep and exhastive. The fort is approached through seven huge gateways or 'pols', which are guarded by watch tower and massive iron spiked doors.

    <h3 class="mt-2"> Rana Kumbha Palace</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      The Rana Kumbha Palace is a fine specimen of Rajput's architecture. It is a huge structure, built of sandstones, which are not of equal proportions. The palace is raised high from a large basement which is in the shape of a rectangle. The walls are ornamented with artificial battlements and turrets. The remarkable feature of the palace is its splendid series of canopied balconies. The entrance to the palace is through two gateways known as Suraj Pol and Tripolia Gate leading further to Suraj Gokhra, Zanana Mahal, and Kanwarpada-ka-Mahal in the open courtyard.

      The palaces of Panna Dhai and Meerabai are situated in the southern part of this palace complex. A grand old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and stables of horses and elephants are placed nearby. The Nau Lakha Bandar (nine lakh treasury) building, the royal treasury of Chittor was also located close by. Now, across from the palace is a museum and archeological office. The Singa Chowri temple is also nearby.

<h3 class="mt-3">Rani Padmini Palace / Padmini Mahal</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
  Padmini Palace was once the palatial abode of the exquisitely beautiful Rajput queen, Rani Padmini, the wife of King Rawal Ratan Singh. Revered as an epitome of beauty, Rani Padmini was the daughter of a Sinhala ruler Gandharvasen and plays a crucial role in the history of the gallant Rajput warriors. This queen was mentioned in the epic poem of 'Padmavati', which had been composed during 1540 CE, by Malik Muhammad Jayasi.

  Rani Padmini Palace leaves behind the tincture of beauty, valour, sacrifice, honour, and tragedy of the past. Padmini Palace was the very legendary palace from where Ala-ud-din Khilji was permitted to obtain a glimpse of Padmini in a mirror placed in the main hall. Allured by her beauty, Ala-ud-din Khilji fought a fierce battle with Rana Ratan Singh, husband of Rani Padmini. Rani Padmini was augmented by her preference of death to abduction and dishonour during the historic siege of Chittor in 1303 AD, by Ala-ud-din Khilji. As an aftermath, Ala-ud-din Khilji killed thirty thousand Hindus in revenge and entrusted the fort to his son Khizr Khan.

<h3 class="mt-3"> Kalika Mata Temple </h3>
<p class="text-justify">
 Built originally in the 8th century, this serene temple was dedicated to the worship of the sun god before it was converted into a shrine for Kalika, an incarnation of Goddess Durga, in the 14th century. This temple is one of the most important pilgrimage attractions in Chittorgarh, and should not be missed when touring the grounds of the Chittorgarh fort and and is one of the best places to visit in Chittorgarh.

 The architecture of the temple reflects the devotion of its builders- a lot of hard work has been put into the intricate carvings and embellishments that adorn the ancient walls of the temple. Even though it is partially in ruins now, the beauty of the temple still shines through.
